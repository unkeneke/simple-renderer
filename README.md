# Simple Sofware Renderer

C++ application made with the purpose of studying the underlying functionality of a rendering API like OpenGL. 

This project doesn't use code from existing graphic libraries, instead the idea is to create every 2D and 3D drawing calculation from scratch, to gather a better understanding of the mathematics behind it.

This program was completed by studying the material from the excellent [TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) project by Dmitry V. Sokolov.
