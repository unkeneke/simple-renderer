# Simple Sofware Renderer

C++ application made with the idea of recreating and studying the underlying functionality of a rendering API like OpenGL. 

This project doesn't use anything from existing graphic libraries, instead the idea is to create every 2D and 3D drawing calculation from scracth, with the purpose of gathering a better understanding of the mathematics behind it.

This program was completed by studying the material from the excellent [TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) project by Dmitry V. Sokolov.
